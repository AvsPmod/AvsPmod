How to build
------------

To build AvsPmod, check that all the requirements are met and run 'AvsP_build.py'.
A ZIP or 7z archive will be created in its same directory.


Requirements
------------

- Python (versions 2.5-2.7 supported)
- Microsoft runtime DLLs (see below)
- wxPython (2.6-2.8 supported, 2.9 MAY work)
- py2exe
- editbin (optional)
- UPX (optional)
- 7-Zip (optional)


Python 2.6+ only
----------------

Some Microsoft Visual C runtime DLLs are needed: 'msvcm90.dll', 'msvcp90.dll' 
and 'msvcr90.dll'.  Chances are that these files are already present in your 
system.  In that case the build script will pick them up automatically.

If they don't, install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package 
(x86) <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29> or take them
from Visual Studio or another application and place them in the same directory 
as the AvsPmod source files (the version needed is 9.0.21022.8).


Python 2.5 only
----------------

'msvcr71.dll' is needed if you're building AvsPmod with Python 2.5.  Normally 
you don't have to include it manually.


editbin
-------

The editbin.exe application can be used optionally to mark the executable 
produced by py2exe with the large address aware flag.  This way AvsPmod can 
use up to 4 GB in a 64-bit environment instead of the 2 GB default. Editbin 
is installed together with Visual Studio 10.  Besides PATH, the build script 
will also try to find this application in its VS 10 subdirectory.


UPX, 7-Zip
----------

UPX can be used to compress the executable files.  If 7-Zip is present, a 7z 
archive is created instead of ZIP.  The build script searchs for them in the 
'Program Files' folder. You can also just put upx.exe and/or 7z.exe in the 
same directory as the source code files.
