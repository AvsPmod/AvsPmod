--------------------------

- Fixed garbage data displayed on shortcut labels
- Fixed wrong checked/unchecked status for 'Flip' menu items.
- Improve menu item 'Hide the preview' to 'Show/Hide the preview.
- Fixed missing customized function presets (This situation happened if an uninstalled plugin is not in filterdb.dat and has no customized definition. Now, avsp will check and keep its definiton as customized definition to avoid missing its preset. If the reason is from renaming, you can copy old preset to new one and then delete. But, leaving it there is also harmless.)


Version 2.1.6 [2011-05-23]
--------------------------

- Add 'Show autocomplete with variables' to 'Program setting|Text2'. AvsPmod will parse the script and add variable names to the autocomplete list.
- Add 'Show autocomplete on single matched' to 'Program setting|Text2'. This can be helpful when using lowercase, such as for a variable name.
- Add 'Show autocomplete with icons' to 'Program setting|Text2'. This should be helpful to decide which key is better to finish autocomplete, <Enter> or <Tab>. There are 3 different types of icon to indicate how well a filter's preset is defined:
  - OK icon: well-defined (100%)
  - Smile icon: good (>70%)
  - None: 30-70%
  - Question icon: bad (<30%)
- Remove "Allow hyphen in identifier" and also remove illegal long names from autocomplete list.
- Add 'ESC' into "Configure shortcuts->Advanced". If checked, one press doesn't run shortcut command when autocomplete or calltip is active. A second press is needed. If unchecked, directly run command. Default: unchecked.
- Add "Show warning on bad plugin naming" to "Program settings->Misc". If plugin dll files contain characters other than alphanumeric or underscore, it will be suggested that you rename them.
- Allow autocomplete auto active on starting with underscore if there are matched words existing.
- When autocomplete or calltip is active, pressing related shortcut again will cancel it.
- Fixed an issue with filenames in the encoding gui.

- 'Tab' key in the slider window is changed to navigate to the next control inside this window.

Version 2.1.3 [2011-04-27]
--------------------------
